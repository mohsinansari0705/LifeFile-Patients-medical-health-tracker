## üöÄ The Problem: Fragmented & Confusing Health Records

In today's world, our medical history is scattered across various clinics, hospitals, and labs. This fragmentation makes it incredibly difficult for patients to get a complete picture of their health. Key challenges include:

-   **Scattered Information:** Records are siloed, leading to an incomplete health history.
-   **Complex Medical Jargon:** Lab reports and doctor's notes are often filled with technical terms that are hard for the average person to understand.
-   **Reactive Healthcare:** Patients often deal with health issues as they arise, with little guidance on proactive or preventive care.
-   **Lack of Personalization:** Healthcare advice is often generic and not tailored to an individual's specific history and risk factors.
